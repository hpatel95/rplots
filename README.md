# This git is a rendering of Rplots and R data management processes coded and practiced during my 2020 Bachelor internship.
Two main parts : R Plots (currently barplots, distributionplots, lineplots, lollipopplots, piecharts and "prototypes" : infographics and Sankey diagram) and R Data Management processes.

*Work inspired and adapted from these ressources :
datacamp.com, listendata.com, medium.com, plot.ly/r, r-graph-gallery.com.*
